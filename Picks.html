        <h2><u>Picks:</u></h2>
        
        <h3>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</h3>
        <p>Guitar picks are made out many materials, pastic, metal, rubber felt, and wood. The typical guitar pick is shaped like a triangle with two of the corners rounded and the other end is less round. Usually, guiitar picks are used so that the guitar player is able to strum chords and be able to hear the individual notes when a string gets played. With a pick, the guitar produces a brighter and clearer sound compared to when you play it with your fingertips or fingernails. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Some of the following guitar pick brands are very familiar to every guitar player out there. You can read more information on each of the brands below.</p>
        
        <p class="sub"><u><b>FENDER</b></u>: 
        <br />  <br />
        Fender has many different picks to choose from depending on you preference. They have materials such as Celluloid, which is a plastic that most guitar picks are made out of; others include, Delrin, which is another plastic and it has a slightly dull finish (this allows the guitar player to grip it easier), and the final material that is offered is Nylon, which can have raised lettering on it so it is also easier to grip when playing guitar.<br /><br/>
        
        Fender has different shapes being, small which are commonly known as Jazz pick. Guitar players often use them for speed when playing guitar. They also have large picks, which have three corners that are exactly the same on each side and this makes it easier to hold the pick. The final shape is standard, which is the typical shape for most guitar picks out there.<br />
        <br />    
        The final aspect of Fender's picks is the thickness, which Fender has four thicknesses; thin, medium, heavy, and extra heavy. Thin is known to range between .40 and .60mm, and give a lighter and natural sound. Medium range between .60 and .80mm, which is the most common thickness among guitarists. Medium picks have more flexibility for rhythm guitar playing. Heavy sized picks range from .80mm to 1.2mm, which gives you more control to when playing; it also cleans up your playing and is very useful for anyone normally playing lead guitar. As for Extra Heavy, it ranges from 1.2mm or higher. This pick is used when you are playing jazz music.

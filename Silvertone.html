        <h3>BACKROUND INFORMATION:</h3>
        <p> The Silvertone Model 1449 was known to be the most clever concepts in the 1960's because the guitar came in a case with a 5-watt amplifier, which later became a 6-watt amp built into it. This means all you have to do is open the guitar case, stand the guitar up, plug it in, switch the amplifier on, and start rocking. A year after the guitar came out with the amplifier built in, this case really took off, and started a new fashion with in the world of guitar.
        </p>
        <h3>SOUND:</h3>
        <p> The sound of the Silvertone Model 1449 has a single coil pickup, with a short-neck model. The pickup in the guitar has a clear and crisp sound when it is plugged into the amplifier. The bridge on the guitar is a through-body adjustable bridge that makes you able to adjust what kind of sound you want to make. The sound can have more of a rock feel or more of a jazz feel; whatever your in the mood for.

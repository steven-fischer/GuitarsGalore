        <h3>BACKROUND INFORMATION:</h3>
        <p>Reverse Tension Guitars are a unique type of acoustic guitar because unlike the typical acoustic guitar that most people are used to, the Reverse Tension guitar's strings don't stop at the bridge of the guitar, they go to the end of the body of the guitar. This type of guitar is known to relieve most of the pressure when playing the strings on the bridge of the guitar. Another cool aspect of this guitar is that it has a lip unlike normal guitars, so the guitar player's elbow is more comfortable when resting your arm on the body of the guitar while playing.
        </p>
        <p>Even though this seems like a new concepts in the world of guitars, it was also notably used on the following guitars, including: the Gibson 1965 L-50, Epiphone Emperor, 1939 Gibson Kalamazoo, Archtop, 1970 Gibson L5. </p>
        <h3>SOUND:</h3>
        <p> Since the strings are strung passed the bridge of the guitar, it gives the guitar some room to enhance the volume, as well as the volume, balance, clarity overtones, harmonics. The greatest thing about the sound is that it has a greater richness of tone than other guitars out there.

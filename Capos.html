        <h2><u>Capos:</u></h2>
        <h3>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</h3>
        <p>A capo, short for capodastro, means "head of fretboard". It is a device that a guitarist uses to change the way the strings are played. It raises the pitch and changes the key in which the guitar is played in. Also, it allows the guitar player to use the same types of chords that they normally would be if they played the specific chord.      
        </p>
       
        <h3><b>TYPES OF CAPOS:</b></h3>
        
        <p>There are multiple types of capos that guitarists can use on their guitars, and there are listed below with some history of each on how they came to be.</p>
        
        <p class="sub"><b><u>KYSER LOW-TENSION QUICK-CHANGE CAPO:</u></b>
            <br /><br />
        The Kyser Low-Tension Quick-Change Capo has a low-tension that makes it easier to move up and down the fretboard when playing songs in different keys. Being a low-tension capo means that you can hold down all the strings while using the capo, and not have to worry about the strings being dulled or sharpened when it is placed on the guitar's neck. This type of capo has 25% less spring tension than other types you may find out there in todayâ€™s world of guitar.

        <p class="sub"><b><u>STANDARD SHUBB C-SERIES CAPO:</u></b>
            <br /><br />    
        The Standard Shubb C-Series capo was first introduced to the world in the 1970's, and was designed by the co-founders of the Shubb company, Rick Shubb and Dave Coontz. The Shubb capo is best known for not causing any problems with your guitar going out of tune because it is on the neck and has a soft, resilient rubber that makes it so the strings don't bend over the frets. This makes it so that you don't have to retune as often when the capo puts your guitar out of tune. You can even place it and remove it easier from the neck of the guitar quicker and easier because of the lever at the end of the capo.

        <p class="sub"><b><u>THALIA CAPO:</u></b> 
            <br /><br />
        The Thalia capo was created by Chris and Thalia Bradley and was first thought of in 2010 by eight year old, Thalia and later was manufactured by her dad, Chris. The capo itself has a unique design which allows the guitarist to easily move the capo up and down the guitar neck. There are over two hundred different combinations of designs that you can choose from. What makes this capo unique from all the other capos is that you can actually can use the capo on any style of guitar without worrying about the strings becoming sharp because they have multiple interchangable pads that fit almost every guitar neck width.

        <p class="sub"><b><u>G7th NEWPORT CAPO:</u></b>
        <br /> <br />
        The G7th Newport is a small light weight and low profile capo that is specifically designed for a twelve string guitar, but is also available for the six string guitar. This capo has the ability for fine tune adjustments to make sure the guitar can dial in the perfect tone. It also reduces tuning instability and allows you to play longer without having to retune every time you play. Overall, the Newport capo is a great capo for the guitar player that likes to use a twelve-string guitar because it is specialized for that type and not many capos support the twelve string as well as the G7th Newport capo.
